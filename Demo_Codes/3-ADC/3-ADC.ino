/* This program demonstrate how to read the values of the input on of the analog-digital converter
 * This ADC has several automated or manual mode, we will see only the manual mode. 
 * 
 * Once the values are read they are converted in amps and degrees and printed on the serial port.
 * Note that the current measurment can be unreliable when the current is really small. This is 
 * due to the value of the measuring resistor value being very small.
